## INTRODUCTION:
  In the era of the 21st century, when the world is running at a speed that seems like the speed of air, All developers, workers, or any other working profession is so much busy in their world! But, What about Entertainment (Manoranjan!), Entertainment is not just for health but it is also good for our soul! For this, my Manoranjan website will help you, as it contains at least more than 5000 movie datasets according to your choice! You always search on google for movie ratings, and know about top casts! This recommendation engine will help you to solve this! You don‚Äôt need to google each and everything about movie. You have our ‚ÄúManoranjan App‚Äù for this, not only this, you can add your favorite movie like a to-do list for later!
  This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies, etc.

The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using `beautifulsoup4` and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.

Don't worry if the movie that you are looking for is not auto-suggested. Just type the movie name and click on "enter". You will be good to go even though if you made some typo errors.

## Architecture

![Recommendation App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36665975/168742738-5435cf76-1a42-4d87-94b4-999e5bfc48d3.png)

## Similarity Score : 

   How does it decide which item is most similar to the item user likes? Here come the similarity scores.
   
   It is a numerical value ranges between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar to each other on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained measuring the similarity between the text details of both of the items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.
   
## How Cosine Similarity works?
  Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, higher the cosine similarity.
